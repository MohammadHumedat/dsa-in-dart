# QUEUE concepts:-

- Queue is a data structure in Dart. Queues follow the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle and are useful for managing tasks, buffering data, and more.

- Basic queue operations:

Enqueue (add element)

Dequeue (remove element)

front (view front element)

isEMPTY to Check if the queue is empty

- FIFO Real-World Example
  Imagine a print queue:

User A sends a document to print.

User B sends another document.

The printer prints User A's document first, then User B's.

This order is maintained because of the FIFO rule.
