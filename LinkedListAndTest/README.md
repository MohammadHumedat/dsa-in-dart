# Doubly Linked List in Dart

A simple generic doubly linked list implementation in Dart with a full set of features and tests.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- `lib/doubly_linked_list.dart`: The linked list implementation.
- `bin/main.dart`: Demonstrates how to use the linked list.
- `test/doubly_linked_list_test.dart`: Unit tests using `package:test`.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Run the example:

```bash
dart run bin/main.dart



# sample :
Insert at head:
1
2

Insert at tail:
1
2
3
4

Insert at index 2:
1
2
99
3
4

List printed backward:
4
3
99
2
1

Contains 99? true
Get at index 2: 99
List length: 5

Delete 99:
1
2
3
4




# Circular Linked List in Dart

This project demonstrates a generic circular singly linked list with insert, delete, search, and access capabilities.
ðŸ”„ How Circular References Are Handled
In a circular linked list, the last node doesn't point to null like in a traditional singly linked list. Instead, it points back to the head node, forming a closed loop. This allows traversal to cycle through the list indefinitely unless explicitly controlled.

Key Implementation Details:
Each node holds a value and a reference to the next node.

The last node's next pointer always refers to the head node to maintain circularity.

On insertion, if the list is empty, the new node points to itself. Otherwise, itâ€™s added after the current tail, and the tailâ€™s next is updated to point to the head.

On deletion, links are updated to bypass the removed node. If the removed node is the head or tail, special care is taken to update head and tail references while keeping the circle intact.

Traversal is done using a loop that breaks when the next node is the head again, ensuring that each node is visited only once and preventing infinite loops.

This structure enables continuous looping behavior, which is useful in scenarios like round-robin scheduling, buffer management, or any system that cycles through elements repeatedly.

## How Circular References Are Handled

Each node points to the next node, and the last node points back to the head node. All traversals stop when the starting node is reached again, ensuring we donâ€™t enter an infinite loop.
```

Unit tests using the package:test/test.dart framework:

âœ… Insert and verify cycle: After inserts, check last node points to head.

âœ… Delete and ensure circular integrity: After deletes, confirm list still loops properly.

âœ… Traversal correctness: Traverses nodes once; avoids infinite loop.

âœ… Length, contains, getAt: Validates correctness of these methods.

âœ… Edge cases: Tests for an empty list, a one-node list, and full deletion.
